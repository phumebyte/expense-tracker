# ðŸ’° Expense Tracker

A simple and intuitive Expense Tracker that allows users to manage their finances easily by tracking incomes and expenses. The application displays a user summary with total income, total expenses, and balance. Users can add transactions with a custom description, choose a transaction type (income or expense), and input the amount. All transactions are dynamically listed and can be deleted with a click.

## âœ¨ Features

  Displays the total balance, total income, and total expenses.

- **Add Transactions**  
  Add a new transaction by entering a description, selecting the transaction type (income/expense), and specifying the amount.

- **Transaction List**  
  Each new transaction is appended to the list dynamically, showing the description and amount with color-coded styling (green for income, red for expense).

- **Delete Transactions**  
  Remove transactions by clicking the delete button next to each list item. Balance, income, and expenses are automatically recalculated.

- **Form Validation**  
  - Ensures all fields are filled.
  - Validates description (at least 2 characters, non-numeric).
